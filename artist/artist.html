  <div id="Musical style and reviews">
    <h2>Musical style and reviews</h2>
<p2>Skriptonit positions his work as "Kazakh rap" and disapproves of those who call him a "Russian performer" doing "Russian rap". His first lyrics were devoted to children's problems and school, then there was a short period of so-called "rap about rap", and he began to raise current topics in the early 2010s.
  In his songs, unlike other Russian-speaking rappers experimenting with "deep" lyrics, Skriptonit emphasizes the musical component, which he often does himself. The peculiar pronunciation, which is jokingly called "Yeltsin-floo", and "half-drunk" voice gave a unique sound for his debut album. 
  In order to avoid other people's influence, Scriptonite practically does not listen to songs in Russian, including works by other rap artists</p2>
